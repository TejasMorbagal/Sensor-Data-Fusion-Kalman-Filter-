# Sensor-Data-Fusion-Kalman-Filter

A really cool branch of ML/signal processing is sensor fusion, sometimes also referred to as data fusion, target tracking, filtering etc. 


Sensor Data Fusion at its core is essentially about combining what you observe from a process with what you know about the process. A process is anything that evolves over time.
